## "Maybe-resources"

_Not primary resources, but potentially still relevant._

OSes (that are either not for embedded, or don't include a networking stack, or both):

- Tifflin (rust_os): experimental kernel [!embedded, networking]
- moros: requires BIOS, only x86-64 arch [!embedded, networking]
- aero: 64 bit, higher half kernel [!embedded, networking]
- kerla, [!embedded, networking]
- intermezzo: for learning how to write an OS [!embedded, !networking]
- felix: targets x86 [!embedded, !networking]
- rCore: OS on RISCV [?embedded, networking]
- ArceOS: unikernel [?embedded, networking]
- zCore: reimplementation of Zircon microkernel in Rust
  - unfortunately almost all docs on this are in chinese
- RustyHermit: x86 unikernel [embedded, networking]
- stardust-oxide: builds on Xen Hypervisor that manages the physical ressources [!embedded, networking]

Networking stacks/ utilities (all require rust std library?):

- ntex: framework for composable networking services
- net2
- socket2
- libc
- nix: implement libc in rust
- naia: networkign architecture for interactive applications (multiplayer)
