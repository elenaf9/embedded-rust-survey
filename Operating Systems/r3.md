# R3-OS

RTOS for deeply embedded systems

- all kernel objects statically defined
- no external build tools
- kernel API not tired to specific kernel implementations
  - kernels provided as separate crates that app can choose
- leverage rust system for accessing kernel objects

## Core 

low level interface between kernel and application code

- trait for kernel implementations
- common data types

### System Type

- System<SystemTraits> (see above)
- "system type": marker type around which a r3 app is build
- trait implementations provided by kernel implementation
  - `r3::kernel::raw::KernelBase` 
  - static configuration: config at compile time, based on configuration function
    - highly composable: can make ensted calls to otehr config functions
  

### Object Handles

- owned handle: dynamically created object (not supported yet)
- borrowed handle: lifetime'd reference to an object owned by different part
- static handle: borrowed handle referencing static object
- implements "Object Safety"
  - all function that operated on raw object IDs are `unsafe`
    - can only be accessed from safe code via object handles
  - owener of owned handle controls object's lifetime

### System States

- CPU lock: disable all managed interrupts & dispatching
  - e.g. to create a critical setion
- Priority Boost: temporarily raise prio of current task
  - block system calls are disallowed
- _inspired by microITORN4.0

### Threads

- main thread
 - startup hooks can be registered
    - have cpu lock, should never deactivate CPU lock
- after main thread: multitasking
- own threads for first-level interrupt handler on async external events
  - always runs to completion but may be preempted by ohter inerrupt handlers
  - no blocking sys calls allowed
  - calls associated application-provided second-level itnerrupt handler- **Task**: kernel object that can create a thread whose execution is controlled by application code
  - encapsulated state data for execution & sceheduling of associated thread
    - stack region to store local vars
    - current prio
    - parking state of task
    - memory region to save CPU registers
  - thread started by activating task
=> thread = "task or interrupt handler"

### Interrupt handling

- optional Trait `KernelInterruptLine`
  - kernel may implement it for system type
  - application can then use it to
    - configure interrupt lines
    - attach interrupt handlers
- benefits:
  1. increase portability
  2. well-defined sematics of sys call inside an interrupt handler
  3. decouple hardware driver component son systems with non-vecotized interrupt controller or multiplexed interrupt lines
- downsides:
  1. obscuring non-standard hardware features
  2. interference with other way of managing interrupt (.e.g board support packages)
  3. additional layer of abstraction
- on interrupt:
  1. determine type and priority
  2. transfer control to first-level itnerrupt handler (that is generated by the kernel)
    - = interrupt handler
  3. first-level itnerrupt handler executes one or more 2nd-level interrupt handlers defined by the application sequentially
    - = interrupt service routine
    - some system calls not allwoed in 2nd-level interrupt handlers
    - unless for "unmanaged" handlers, marked as "unmanaged-safe"
      - can interrupt other handlers
      - can use all system calls, but behaviour is undefined
      - interrupt handlers in a "Unmanaged" priority range must register such a handler
   
### Kernel Timing

- time unit: microseconds
- system clock: exposes global system time
- tick frequency tied to internal hardware (implemented by port)
      
## R3 original Kernel implementation

<https://docs.rs/r3_kernel/0.1.4/r3_kernel/>

- tickless real-time kernel with preemptive, priority scheduling
- software-based scheduler
- unlimited number of tasks
- kernel split into target-independent and target-specific portion
  - applications combine them using the trait system
- kernel can be combined by user from multiple components
  - use macros: 
   - `r3_xxx_port::use_port!`: port-provided macro to instantiate port-specific items
    - `r3_kernel::build` instatiate kernel & kernel-private static data based on kernel config suplied in form of a config config function

```rust
type System = r3_kernel::System<SystemTraits>;
r3_port_std::use_port!(unsafe struct SystemTraits);

struct Objects { /* ... */ }
const fn configure_app(_: &mut r3_kernel::Cfg<SystemTraits>) -> Objects
{ /* ... */ }

const COTTAGE: Objects = r3_kernel::build!(System, configure_app => Objects);
```

port specific part/ macro implements:
- description of properties of target hardware
- Port:
  - `PortThreading`: items related to low-level operations for controllung CPU states & context switching
  - `PortInterrupts`: 1-level interrupt handlers:items related controlling interrupt lines
    - should call second-level interrupt handlers from KernelCfg2
  - `PortTimer`: items related to controlling a system timer
- static items to store internal state data

build!:
- define static items to store kernel-private data structures:
  - `TASK_CB_POOL`,
- implements kernel cfg:
  - KernelCfg1:
    - Nr of task priority levels
  - KernelCfg2: 
    - table of combined second-level interrupt handlers
    - access to kernels global state
- creates `CFG` based on config function
- `PortTOKernel {boot(), choose_running_task(), timer_tick()}` autoimplemented for `S: Port + KernelCfg1 + KernelCfg2`

- Traits from `r3_core::kernel::raw` are auto-derived if all traits are implementd by the macros above
